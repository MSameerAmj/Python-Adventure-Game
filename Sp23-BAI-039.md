Contribution to the Castle Adventure Game
As a contributor to the Castle Adventure Game, I was responsible for key aspects of both the game mechanics and the overall user experience. My primary contributions included the design and implementation of the game world, item mechanics, hurdles, and the save/load system. Below is a detailed breakdown of my work:

1. Game World Design (Map, Items, and Hurdles):
I created the map dictionary, which defines the layout and structure of the game world. Each location (such as the courtyard, throne room, and armory) was designed with a unique description and specific items or hurdles for the player to interact with. The map serves as the backbone for navigation, allowing the player to move between different areas using directional commands.

The Items_in_game dictionary was another key component I developed. This dictionary defines the various interactive items within the game (e.g., sword, torch, map). Each item has associated attributes such as its description, status, and the specific functionality or limitation when the player attempts to use or interact with it. This provides the core structure for item management in the game.

I also designed the hurdles system, which introduces challenges that players must overcome to progress in the game. Each hurdle (like the iron_gate or the lever) is locked behind a specific requirement, such as using an item like the key or solving a riddle. This added depth and complexity to the gameplay by creating obstacles that players must solve in order to advance.

2. Saving and Loading Game Progress:
To enhance the player experience and allow for longer gameplay sessions, I implemented a save and load system using JSON. This feature enables players to save their game state, including their current location, inventory, and any hurdles they have already overcome, into a JSON file. They can then load their saved game and resume from where they left off.

The save function stores the player's current location, the items in their inventory, and the hurdles they have unlocked into a JSON object. This object is then written to a file (Saved_Game.json), ensuring that the game state is preserved.

The Load function reads the JSON file and restores the player's location, inventory, and progress through the hurdles. This allows the player to seamlessly continue their game without losing progress.

3. Main Game Loop and Core Functionality:
I developed the main game loop that governs the flow of gameplay. This loop continuously prompts the player for commands such as move, take, use, and look, allowing them to interact with the game world.

The main gameplay logic handles various actions:

Moving between locations: Based on the player's input, the game checks for valid exits and determines whether a hurdle must be cleared before the player can proceed.
Managing inventory: Players can take items, drop them, or check their inventory at any point during the game.
Solving riddles and unlocking hurdles: Players can interact with puzzles and obstacles to progress further in the game.
Saving and quitting: Players have the option to save their game and quit at any point, with the ability to return later and load their previous progress.
By integrating the game world, item interaction, hurdle challenges, and a flexible save/load system, I helped shape the overall gameplay experience, ensuring that players have a rich, engaging adventure while exploring the castle and its many mysteries.
