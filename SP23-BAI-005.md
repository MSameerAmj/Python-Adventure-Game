1.Move Function
The move(direction) function allows the player to navigate through the game’s world. It takes a direction (north, south, east, or west) as input and moves the player from the current location to a connected one if an exit exists in that direction. If there is no valid exit, the player is informed that they cannot move in that direction.
•	Usage: move('north')
•	Example: If the player is in the "courtyard" and moves north, they may enter the "armory" if the appropriate hurdle (like an iron gate) has been solved.
•	Functionality:
o	Checks if the direction has an exit in the current location.
o	Validates if any hurdles block the path (like locked gates) and provides a message on how to proceed.
o	Moves the player to the next location and displays a description of the new area.
1.	Use Function
The use(item) function allows the player to utilize items from their inventory to interact with the game world. The item must be present in the player’s inventory and in the current location for it to be used. This function checks if the item can solve a hurdle or trigger an action.
•	Usage: use('key')
•	Example: The player uses a 'key' to open a locked gate or a 'torch' to illuminate a dark room.
•	Functionality:
o	Verifies if the item is in the player's inventory and can be used in the current location.
o	If the item is linked to solving a specific hurdle (e.g., opening a gate or unlocking a door), it changes the game state, allowing the player to proceed.
o	Provides feedback if the item cannot be used in the current situation.
2.	Examine Function
The examine(item) function allows the player to inspect items in their current location. It describes the item and hints at its possible use or importance in the game. If the item cannot be used yet, the player receives information about what they might need to do in order to use it.
•	Usage: examine('torch')
•	Example: The player examines a 'book' on a table and learns that it cannot be opened until a riddle is solved.
•	Functionality:
o	Provides a detailed description of the item.
o	If the item is a key component of a puzzle or hurdle, the player is given a clue about what is required to unlock its functionality.
o	Offers a message if the item cannot be examined in the current location.
These functions enhance the interactivity of the game by allowing players to explore, interact with, and make progress through their decisions and inventory management.
